# This script is for creating, deleting and listing user accounts in kubeflow
# and is available for kubeflow v1.5, v1.6, v1.7
# 
# Below things are prerequisite before executing this script
# 1. run as root
# 2. install apache2-utils package to enable hashing passwords
# 3. At least one administrator account must exist also its home directory too. And you have to input the name in USER variable
# 4. All accounts will be recorded in $HOME/profile.yaml so please check if you have an existing one not to be overwritten
#
# how it works
# 1. All accounts are recorded in $HOME/profile.yaml and config-map.yaml in dex directory
# 2. every account's email format is united as '@example.com'. For example, if you created one account whose name is 'admin', its email will be 'admin@example.com' automatically.
